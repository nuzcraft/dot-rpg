# Devlog

## Are devlogs important?
### 2023.01.20

Idk if it's important to collect my thoughts, but here they are for now
* I started this project a few days ago, I like the concept of a simple RPG to help me understand how those mechanics might work in Godot
* I want to try to build classes with appropriate inheritance and composition, and make decent structural decisions that might be scalable
* I thought a low res rpg about a dot might be cool, screen resolution 64x36
* I'm going to double the res to make it easier to use the godot controls (mostly buttons) since then hopefully I can make it so that they don't overlap
